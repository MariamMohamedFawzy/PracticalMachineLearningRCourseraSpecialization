This is the report for the project for Practical Machine learning course on Coursera

The steps I have followed:
1. Load the data (train and test)
2. Look at the data and do some preprocessing:
	Remove unnecessary columns
	Convert some columns to factor or numeric
3. Split the training data into train and valid splits.
4. Build the random forest model using cross validation of 5 folds
5. Get the final predictions for the test data
